          Building a Web Application from Scratch: A Journey Back to Basics
        </h1>

        <p>
          Inspired by the idea of a post-apocalyptic IT world, where we would
          need to rebuild everything from scratch (including logic gates,
          processors, and memory), I began to wonder how I'd fare if I had to
          start from the basics of web development as we know it today, but from
          the late 1990s. Realizing I wouldn't know where to start, I decided to
          undertake a small project: building a web application using only HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript.

        <h2>Here's the plan:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Use 2024 versions of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.</li>
          <li>Rely solely on current browsers.</li>
          <li>Avoid any libraries.</li>
          <li>Create both a website and a simple application.</li>
          <li>
            This article will provide an overview of the project, with in-depth
            details reserved for separate posts as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The page you are reading now will also be part of the project.
          </li>
          <li>
            I may allow small deviations from these guidelines if they make
            sense (e.g., not using outdated browsers, not avoiding Git, or not
            creating a text formatter from scratch).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We've come a long way with tools like <code>package.json</code>, hot
          reloading, TypeScript, and numerous libraries. At this stage, I'm not
          sure what challenges I'll face or what tools I'll miss most, so this
          project is sure to evolve.
