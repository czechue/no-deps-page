          Building a Web Application from Scratch: A Journey Back to Basics
        </h1>

      <section>
        <p>
          Inspired by the idea of a post-apocalyptic IT world, where we would
          need to rebuild everything from scratch (including logic gates,
          processors, and memory), I began to wonder how I'd fare if I had to
          start from the basics of web development as we know it today, but from
          the late 1990s. Realizing I wouldn't know where to start, I decided to
          undertake a small project: building a web application using only HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript.

        <h2>Here's the plan:</h2>

        <h3><i>30.06.2024</i></h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Use 2024 versions of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and <s>Node.js</s>.
            <i>(However, I decided to use Bun (I can't answer why))</i>
          </li>
          <li>Rely solely on current browsers.</li>
          <li>Avoid any libraries.</li>
          <li>Create both a website and a simple application.</li>
          <li>
            This article will provide an overview of the project, with in-depth
            details reserved for separate posts as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The page you are reading now will also be part of the project.
          </li>
          <li>
            I may allow deviations from these guidelines if they make sense
            (e.g., not using outdated browsers, not avoiding Git, or not
            creating a text formatter from scratch).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <p>
          We've come a long way with tools like <code>package.json</code>, hot
          reloading, TypeScript, and numerous libraries. At this stage, I'm not
          sure what challenges I'll face or what tools I'll miss most, so this
          project is sure to evolve.

        <h2>Local server</h2>
        <p>
          Due to the fact that we want to use the benefits of ESM - we need some
          server for local development. My choice instead of the standard
          <b>node.js</b> environment fell on <b>bun</b>, which I have not had
          the opportunity to use so far. No hot reload to start with - but the
          potential implementation of this functionality in the future sounds
          interesting.
        </p>

        <p>The whole config boils down to a very simple static file server:</p>

        <pre>
        const ASSETS_DIRECTORY = "/../public";

        const server = Bun.serve({
            port: 3000,
            async fetch(req) {
            const rootPath = import.meta.dirname;
            let pathName = new URL(req.url).pathname;

            if (pathName === "/") {
              pathName = "/index.html"
            }

            const publicDirectoryPath = `${rootPath}${ASSETS_DIRECTORY}`;
            const requestedFile = publicDirectoryPath + pathName;

            return new Response(Bun.file(requestedFile);
          },
        });

        console.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${server.port} ...`);
        </pre>

        <p>Ok, now how it works.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            go to the address <i>http://localhost:3000/</i> - the server returns
            the file <b>index.html</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            in the <i>index.html</i> file there are links to <i>index.js</i> and
            <i>styles.css</i> which <b>index.html</b> requests, sending the
            server one request after another:
            <b>http://localhost:3000/index.js</b> and
            <b>http://localhost:3000/styles.css</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            based on the file names - if the file name matches the
            <b>req.url</b> query, the server returns the contents of the
            `public` directory - simple
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Here I decided to let go of the no-deps approach altogether. I do
            not see much point in creating tests in a post-apocalyptic version.
          </p>
          <p>
            For variety, instead of using the currently most popular stack
            (vitest / jest) - I also used bun. From the new libraries I used the
            <b>happy-dom</b> recommended by bun documentation.
